# QR Snap Product Status
QR Snap right now would be classified as Beta software and still requires some level of 'hand holding' through some of our initial subscribers registrations. With that said the overall benefits of using QR Snap far outweigh the inconvenience. Once the initial registration is completed the following steps must be taken to get the full output of QR Snap 

1. Connect your inventory source(s).
    * Dealerspike (direct login) - Complete inventory
    * Dealerspike Feed - Offers partial or complete Inventory
    * CDK3PA - Complete but incurs a monthly cost through CDK

2. Add the QR Snap dealer JS script to your website. This enables website statistics such as the top inventory views and page visit durations which is incredibly useful for creating Facebook posts or just get an overall pulse on the market.

3. Add Facebook Pixel and Google G-Tag scripts to your QR Snap profile to add the ability to create audiences that have scanned QR Codes at your dealership. This comes in handy when you want to create campaigns that directly target actions customers that visit you in person would want to take. Trades, financing, and vehicle service are good examples.

QR Snap is __NOT__ complete as a product but that is different from it being useful or functional. There will be small glitches, broken links, and minor inconveniences as you use this software. With that said I am a small company and offer a direct line of communication with my partners and subscribers. This software was built from he ground up by me. I have built everything from the server hardware to the web interface. This means that if there are any issues I am the one to solve them for your business. No phone trees or departments, just results.
